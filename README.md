# FinTech Case Study - Gusto

## Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin


* Gusto, formerly know as ZenPayroll, is a privately held company founded in November of 2011 by Joshua Reeves (CEO), along side Eddie Kim (CTO) and Tomer London (CPO). It wasn't until September of 2015 that it rebranded itself to what we know today as Gusto. Headquarted in San Francisco, Gusto opened a second office in Denver in mid-2015 with the mission to "put people first".

* The founders of Gusto previoulsy owned private businesses and experienced first had the pain of using other payroll services or doing it manually. The idea of stream lining and automating, expediting and simplifying the process of employee payroll and benefits came to them when they saw how many people were still doing things by hand besides themselves. With an estimated half of six million businesses in the US still managing payroll on paper and with spreadsheets, they saw a huge opportunity in an underserved market that historically did not have access to high-quality software and this is were Gusto was born.

* Upon graduating from Y Combinator's Winter 2012 class Gusto had raised $6.1 million which at the time was the largest seed round for a Y Combinator startup. Initial investors included numerous well know and respected CEO's and founders such as Box CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie, Yammer CEO and cofounder David O. Sacks, Dropbox CEO and Co-founder Drew Houston, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim, Yelp CEO and co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman, Badgeville CEO and co-founder Kris Duggan, SugarCRM CEO Larry Augustin, and Zuora CEO abd co-founder Tien Tzuo, as well as Google Ventures, Data Collective, Sherpalo Ventures and Salesforce.com.

* In February of 2014, Gusto announced a $20 million Series A funding round with a valuation of over $100 million. The round was led by AFSquare, General Catalyst Partners, Obvious Ventures, Designer Fund, Wayne Chang, #Angels, Daniel Gross, Jeff Seibert, Pivot Investment Partners with participation and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. 

* A Series B funding round in April of 2015 was led by Google Capital with Gusto securing $60 million. Later that year in December, Gusto was able to raise another $90 million which valued the company at $1 billion. 

* A Series C investment of $140 million was led by Y Combinator, 137 Ventures, T. Rowe Price, General Catalyst, Dragoneer Investment Group, Emergence Capital, Rose Park Advisors, MSD Capital, CapitalG, Louis Beryl and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

* In Gusto's latest funding round in July of 2019 they were able to raise an additional $200 million from T. Rowe Price, General Catalyst, Dragoneer Investment Group, Generation Investment Management, Fidelity Management and Research Company at a $3.8 billion valuation which brought there total funding to $516.1 million.


## Business Activities:


* Gusto is a small business solution that serves over 100,000 business in a wide variety of industries. Gusto provides a full suite of cloud-based payroll, benefits, and HR solutions to companies nationwide. Gusto was created to automate processes such as paying and filing taxes, so small businesses can run payroll entirely online and on their own without having to become a tax or payroll expert while complying with tax, labor, and immigration laws. Gusto offers employee onboarding as well as employee benefits and related products through third parties, including 401K and workers' compensation insurance.

* Gusto’s flexible payroll feature gives its users the ability to automatically sync worked hours, calculate salary payments and easily amend fields for additional hours and earnings, sickness and annual leave. It calculates and files all relevant taxes for its customers automatically, keeping track of changing tax laws and updating the calculations accordingly. Gusto is compatible for integration with: Xero, Quickbooks, Clover, TSheets, Trainual and more.

* Along with its flexible payroll service, Gusto’s platform has a multitude of easy to use HR and compliance features including the storage of important documents such as payslips, contracts and job description that can be signed online and viewed by employers and employees during their time at the company or after they have left. 

* Gusto also has over 3,500 health insurance plans under its belt from organizations such as BlueCross BlueShield, United Healthcare, Humana, Oscar and Kaiser Permanente, as well as licenced advisors to help its customers find the right plan. Besides health insurance, other benefits that Gusto can accommodate within its platform and provide guidance on include 401(k) plans, flexible spending account, health saving account, commuter benefits, 529 college savings, Life and Disability. Gusto also has the functionality to build welcome packs, handbooks and organizational charts for all new employees as well as setting up and signing a worker’s compensation policy that users can pay-as-you-go rather than all at once.


## Landscape:


* Gusto falls in the Payroll and Benefits domain of the financial industry and is relatively young in a crowded space of established payroll services such as ADP, Zenefits, Paychex, OnPay, Namely and Sage to name a few. Even as a newer company their timing with launching the platform was just right as the widespread acceptance of new digital realities such as paperless transaction processing, cloud-based software solutions, and secure online information transfer, enabled the success of this product. 

* Gusto's product is designed with a people-first mentality to deliver a great user experience for both the employer and the employee. Their easy to use interface and intuitive navigation scheme are the critical attributes that sets them apart from their competitors. Gusto is a cloud-hosted payroll service that doesn't require any special software to install or maintain. You can access the payroll system from any web browser. In addition, the Gusto platform is also mobile friendly and can be accessed from any smartphone or tablet. 

* Gusto’s CTO and co-founder Edward Kim leads the company’s technical team and vision. For their backend APIs they use Ruby on Rails, which serves all of their RESTful JSON API endpoints. Sitting on top of their APIs is their single-page app that is built using React.js. Other technologies they heavily rely on are MySQL, Postgres, Redis, and Sidekiq. They use RSpec and Mocha for testing their Ruby and Javascript code.


## Results


* Gusto gives small business owners peace of mind on the back end which in turn frees up time and saves them money. It holds a special appeal for these owners new to payroll because of its usability while steadily improving and adding new funcionality in areas like contractor payments and benefits while providing excellent support for the complicated tasks it enables. 

* Gusto has built a reputation for offering a simple way to manage one of small business owner’s biggest headaches: payroll. Since then, Gusto has incorporated other HR and people management tools, such as benefits administration, organizational management, and time management. Gusto even offers access to HR professionals to their customers, which lets small business owners tackle complicated questions with expert help. 

* With 98% of trial users converting to a paid plan and an NPS score close to 80, it’s safe to say Gusto is doing the right things on the product side. By building a great product that customers will continue to love is the best way to drive long-term customer retention.


## Recommendations

* Gusto is accessible from any web-enabled device but does not have a mobile app. The most obvious recommendation would be to create a mobile app for users to access and input their information rather than going to a browser.

* Gusto earns high ratings and largely positive feedback from users on most review platforms. The software boasts 4.3/5 stars on G2 Crowd, 4.5/5 stars on Capterra, and 4.5/5 on PCMag. Among the more positive reviews we’ve seen, customers love Gusto’s ease of use, accuracy, cost-effectiveness, useful integrations with business accounting software, their self-onboarding system for new employees, and their ability to handle both payroll and benefits. 

* While on the less positive side, Gusto’s two user reviews on the Better Business Bureau website are both negative, and both reviewers were unhappy with the quality of Gusto’s customer service. While it’s worth noting, however, that we’ve seen reviews from customers who were happy with Gusto’s customer support team. To remedy this issue they could provide proper product training and continued education of tax laws to all customer service representatives. Providing insightful customer service is essential to the business in retaining customers. Adding a live chat feature would also be beneficial to the customer looking for an immediate response.
